## What??

[Rzethon](http://rzethon.pl) was a 24 hour hackathon placed in [Rzeszów](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rzeszów,+Polska/@50.0053456,21.8483723,11z) which started on 10 Dec 2016, 14:05.

This app is just a part of Mars Message System - simulation of a system designed to deliver intergallactic messages by taking time and deliver issues into account. In other words, it needs backend on cosmic nodes and mobile app to send/receive messages to contact our beloved ones.

## Motivation for idea

Humanity will land on Mars. That's for sure. It's expected to happen on small scale in the beginning so it's essential to collect feedback about travel and living there to continue colonization. Contacting on huge distances seems a critical matter in that case. And Mars is just the beginning so design should be like Internet. TCP is there since 1974, even though it was never expected to live so long or used by so wide (even unaware of tech) audience.
